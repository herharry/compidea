In computer science, identifiers (IDs) are lexical tokens that name ^entities. Identifiers are used extensively in virtually all information^ processing systems. Identifying entities makes it possible to refer to ^them, which is essential for any kind of symbolic processing.In ^computer languages, identifiers are tokens (also called symbols) ^which name language entities. Some of the kinds of entities an ^identifier might denote include variables, types, labels, subroutines,^ and packages.Which character sequences constitute identifiers depends on the lexical ^grammar of the language. A common rule is alphanumeric sequences, with underscore^ also allowed, and with the condition that it not begin with a digit (to ^simplify lexing by avoiding confusing with integer literals).For implementations of^ programming languages that are using a compiler, identifiers are often only compile^ time entities. That is, at runtime the compiled program contains references to^ memory addresses and offsets rather than the textual identifier ^tokens (these memory addresses, or offsets, having been assigned by the compiler ^to each identifier)^ÿ
