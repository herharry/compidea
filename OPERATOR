This is a list of operators in the C and C++ programming languages. ^All the operators listed exist in C++. Note that C does not support operator^ overloading.When not overloaded, for the operators &&, ||, and , (the comma^ operator), there is a sequence point after the evaluation of the first operand.^C++ also contains the type conversion operators const_cast, static_cast, ^dynamic_cast, and reinterpret_cast. The formatting of these operators means that their precedence ^level is unimportant.Most of the operators available in C and C++ are also available in other ^languages such as C#, Java, Perl, and PHP with the same precedence, associativity, and semantics.^ÿ
