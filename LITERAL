In computer science, a literal is a notation for representing a fixed value in ^source code. Almost all programming languages have notations for atomic values such as ^integers, floating-point numbers, and strings, and usually for booleans and characters; some also^ have notations for elements of enumerated types and compound values such as arrays, records,^ and objects. An anonymous function is a literal for the function type.In contrast to ^literals, variables or constants are symbols that can take on one of a class of fixed values,^ the constant being constrained not to change. Literals are often used to initialize^ variables.^ÿ
